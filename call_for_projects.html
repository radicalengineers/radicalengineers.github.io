          <p>
          We are looking for 5-8 projects to be part of our second cohort, aimed to provide radical organisations with hands-on technical support. We will work with the selected projects to understand their needs and constraints, design an initial approach to the problem and find them the (volunteer) developers and designers that can help make their projects a success.</p>

            <p>Radical Engineers supports organisations and projects with radical aims.</p>
            <p>By radical we mean system-changing:  faced with the threat of mass extinction, a warming globe and rising inequality, we cannot afford to merely fight symptoms, but have to instead radically rethink the economic and social systems that produce them.</p>
            <p>For instance, in addition to removing waste from the oceans, how can we ensure waste never reaches our oceans in the first place?  If you’re working on system-changing projects and are looking for technical support (in the broadest sense of the term), then we may be able to help!</p>
